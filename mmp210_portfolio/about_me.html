    <p>
        My name is Brian Marquez, I am 22 years old. This is my last semester at BMCC, graduating in Spring 2022. My major is in Animation and Motion Graphics. My main interests are in 2D
        and 3D animation, but I have an interest in computer programming and hoping to be a lot more familar with programs like JavaScript and Python. I hope to apply the skills I learn for creating games.
        In the future I hope to work for an independant studio.
